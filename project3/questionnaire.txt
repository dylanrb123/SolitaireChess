243 Puzzle Solver, Project Part 3:  Water, Clock, Chess, Jam

Your Name: Dylan Bannon
Your chosen new puzzle (Chess or Jam): Chess

Teammate Name: Ben Collins


A. DESIGN
---------

1. Explain, in detail, the design of your new puzzle, and how it "connects"
to your common solver.

Similar to the clock puzzle, it implements a puzzle interface with a generic type. The
solver uses a generic puzzle to get the neighbors and find the solution. The GUI is 
independent of the puzzle, using MVC and the Observer/Observable pattern to update.




2. What changes did you need to make to your existing design for part 2?

The solver is mostly unchanged, seeing as it worked fully for part 2. I didn't
get to implement the hint (ran out of time), but if I did, I would have added
a function that could solve from any starting config.


3. Did you and your partner work together on any part of this assignment?
If so, what exactly?   Please note, this was completely acceptable.

No, we did not work together for any of part 3.

8. Please provide any additional feedback regarding your teammate.

9. What was the best part about being able to work on this project as a team?

If either of us ran into issues we could get help.

10. Conversely, what was the worst part about being required to work in a team?
